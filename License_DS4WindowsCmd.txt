//
// Special command line tool for Ryochan7/DS4Windows app to query the status of the app and profile via WinOS command line.
//
// DS4WindowsCmd app does nothing without the DS4Windows host app (DS4Windows host app https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows).
//
// This cmdline console tool just sends commands to the background host app. The host app itself supports the same command options,
// but especially the use of "-command Query.Device#.PropertyName" command is a bit difficult to use in batch scripts with the host app.
// The host app is WPF GUI app, so Windows batch script would not wait for a result and console output is not shown by default.
// This DS4WindowsCmd app solves this problem by sending the command to the host app as a "real" Windows console app. Console apps
// are easier to integrated with Windows batch scripts.
